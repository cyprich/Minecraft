I made a texture pack which changes the texture of enderman and turtle.
I saw it on reddit, original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftMemes/comments/sot9ty/true/

You can see 2 zip files here... Use "EnderTurtle by Cypo.zip" only if you are not using shaders, otherwise use the second one. 
There were some problems with enderman, so I had to do it this way.

To install the texture pack, download which one you want (or both) and move the file to this location: 
	%appdata%\Roaming\.minecraft\resourcepacks
When it's moved, open Minecraft, go to options, select Resource packs and you should see the texture pack there.
